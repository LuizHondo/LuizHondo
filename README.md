# Hi, I'm Luiz Hondo

Web Developer with a background in Systems Analysis and Development (FIAP). I build accessible, fast, and reliable web apps. I write code to make peopleâ€™s lives easier and better. My focus is modern JavaScript, intuitive React UIs, and a solid backend base with Node, Express, and MongoDB.

## About

I like turning product ideas into straightforward interfaces and well-defined APIs. I think in small steps, favor explicit code, and document the edges so teams can move faster later. I care about UX details, naming, and steady delivery.

## What I Do

- Front end: React, JavaScript (ES6+), semantic HTML5, CSS3 with Flexbox and Grid
- Back end: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, authentication with JWT and bcrypt
- Integration: RESTful APIs, async flows, error handling, logging
- Operations: deployments with NGINX and PM2, practical monitoring
- Quality: small functions, readable tests, clear boundaries between client and server

## How I Work

- start simple, ship a working slice, iterate safely
- prefer explicit over clever
- document behavior at the edges and in errors
- respect accessibility and performance from the first commit
